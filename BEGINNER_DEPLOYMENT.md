# 🚀 Beginner's Guide to Deploy Your CSV to NetSuite App

This guide is designed for beginners with no prior deployment experience. We'll use Heroku, which is the easiest platform to deploy to.

## 📋 Prerequisites Checklist

Before we start, make sure you have:

- [ ] A computer with internet connection
- [ ] A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- [ ] About 30 minutes of time

## 🎯 Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Create a Heroku Account

1. Go to [heroku.com](https://heroku.com)
2. Click "Sign up" (it's free!)
3. Fill in your email and create a password
4. Verify your email address

### Step 2: Install Heroku CLI (Command Line Tool)

**For Mac users:**
1. Open Terminal (press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", press Enter)
2. Copy and paste this command:
   ```bash
   brew install heroku/brew/heroku
   ```
3. Press Enter and wait for it to install

**For Windows users:**
1. Go to [devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
2. Download the Windows installer
3. Run the installer and follow the instructions

### Step 3: Login to Heroku

1. Open Terminal/Command Prompt
2. Type: `heroku login`
3. Press Enter
4. It will open your web browser - click "Log in" in the browser
5. Go back to Terminal - you should see "Logged in as [your email]"

### Step 4: Prepare Your Project

1. Open Terminal/Command Prompt
2. Navigate to your project folder:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/parkergilbert/Cursor
   ```
3. Initialize Git (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

### Step 5: Create Your Heroku App

1. In Terminal, type:
   ```bash
   heroku create your-csv-netsuite-app
   ```
   (Replace "your-csv-netsuite-app" with any name you want - it must be unique)

2. You'll see output like:
   ```
   Creating ⬢ your-csv-netsuite-app... done
   https://your-csv-netsuite-app.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/your-csv-netsuite-app.git
   ```

### Step 6: Deploy Your App

1. Add all files to Git:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. Commit your files:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "First deployment"
   ```

3. Deploy to Heroku:
   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   ```
   
   ⏳ **This will take 5-10 minutes** - grab a coffee! ☕

### Step 7: Open Your Live App!

1. Once deployment is complete, type:
   ```bash
   heroku open
   ```
2. Your browser will open to your live app! 🎉

## 🔧 If Something Goes Wrong

### Common Issues and Solutions:

**1. "Command not found: heroku"**
- Solution: The Heroku CLI didn't install properly. Try installing again.

**2. "App name already taken"**
- Solution: Choose a different name for your app (must be unique across all Heroku apps)

**3. "Build failed"**
- Solution: Make sure all files are committed to Git first

**4. "Can't push to Heroku"**
- Solution: Make sure you're logged in with `heroku login`

### Getting Help:

1. **Heroku Status:** [status.heroku.com](https://status.heroku.com)
2. **Heroku Support:** [help.heroku.com](https://help.heroku.com)
3. **Your app logs:** `heroku logs --tail`

## 💰 Cost Information

- **Free Tier:** 550-1000 hours per month (enough for personal use)
- **Paid Plans:** Start at $7/month if you need more resources
- **Your app sleeps after 30 minutes of inactivity** (free tier) but wakes up when someone visits it

---

## 🎯 What's Next?

Now that your app is deployed:

1. **Test it thoroughly** - try uploading different CSV files
2. **Share it** with colleagues who need to convert CSV to NetSuite format
3. **Monitor usage** - check `heroku logs --tail` to see how it's performing
4. **Customize it** - modify the code and redeploy with `git push heroku main`

---

## 🔄 Making Updates

When you want to update your app:

1. Make changes to your code
2. Commit changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Updated feature"
   ```
3. Deploy:
   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   ```

Your changes will be live in a few minutes!
